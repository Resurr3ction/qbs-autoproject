Qbs-AutoProject
---------------

Features
- Automatic detection of projects
- Automatic detection of test projects
- Automatic detection of documentation projects
- Automatic detection of resources
- Automatic detection of inter-dependencies
- Automatic detection of Qt modules dependencies
- Configurable
- Contained in single file

Limitations
- Only projects that follow and do not deviate from configured structure are supported
- Include directory that does not copy the sources structure is not supported as it renders
automatic detection of local include files and external include files within projects impossible

Supported structures of projects
1) Single directory project
- A project where all files are contained within single directory where autoproject.qbs also reside

2) Include directory only
- A project where all files but public headers are contained within single directory

3) Source and include directories
- A project where sources are contained in one directory and public includes in another

4) Source and include and test directories
- A project where sources are contained in one directory, public inludes in another and tests in another

5) Tests alongside sources
- A project where test directory is a subdirectory of source directory

6) Modules
- A project where sources are further divided into components and project has public include directory

7) Subprojects that contain multiple components or even more subprojects
- A complex hierarchical project that has subprojects with possibly more child subprojects and multiple components per each

Components
- QtModule Scanner (optional, if Qt root is defined)
- Headers Scanner (optional, if include dir is defined)
- Project Scanner [two modes: no submodules | submodules]
- Includes Scanner [scans files for all include directives]
- Dependencies Builder [sets dependencies between modules based on he include directives]
- Project Writer [writes temp project(s) files based on gathered data]
